E.g. \"The header title on the homepage has the wrong color\"  -->\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n<!--- Tell us what happens on the website that shouldn't happen. E.g. \"Currently the header title is green.\" -->\r\n\r\nWhen editors for the Ember blog are publishing blog posts, there is no check process for spelling errors involved. This means that oftentimes spelling errors still get through to the website and they have to be fixed afterwards in separate PRs.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n<!--- Tell us what should happen instead - how would you expect this to see fixed? E.g. \"The header title should be Ember orange.\" -->\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have a spellchecking in place which prevents the build of the website to succeed if any spelling errors are detected. The setup should be restricted to the blog (`/source/blog`) for now. The spell checking setup should take into account any language errors of the English language, but should not throw any errors for custom words, code examples or proper nouns / names.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n<!--- This is optional. If you have an idea how this could be fixed, please let contributors know here. -->\r\n\r\nA spell checking plugin that has been useful before for other Ruby apps of the learning team was  [middleman-spellcheck](https://github.com/minivan/middleman-spellcheck). It is encouraged to use the same plugin to add spellchecking to the website as well. See also [this PR](https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/998) to find out how it was setup for the former Guides app.\r\n\r\nYou can check out the [middleman-spellcheck documentation to find out how to allow custom words or entire sections for e.g. code examples](https://github.com/minivan/middleman-spellcheck#usage), as well as how to allow e.g. `@twitter-handles` using [regex rules for exclusion from spell checking](https://github.com/minivan/middleman-spellcheck#options).\r\n\r\nFor getting this change merged, it might also make sense to split up the work into two separate tasks:\r\n\r\n - 1. Setting up the spell checking on a very restricted part of the blog, e.g. only spell-checking the blog posts of the month September in 2018. This allows us to review and improve the spell-checking setup and get it merged\r\n\r\n- 2. Extending the spell checking scope to the entire set of blog posts. This PR would then include all the spelling fixes for the posts that had already been published and possibly a couple more tweaks to the spellchecking rules as needed\r\n\r\nSince the blog already has a lot of content, it might make sense \r\n## Sources\r\n<!--- This is optional. If you can provide a screenshot or a screen recording of something that needs to be improved, please paste these here. -->\r\n\r\nCheck out these issues and PRs for more context on this task:\r\n\r\n- Original issue: https://github.com/emberjs/website/issues/2488\r\n- Setup for middleman-spellcheck on the former guides app: https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/998\r\n- Middleman Spellcheck Docs: https://github.com/minivan/middleman-spellcheck#middleman-spellchecker\r\n- The Ember Blog: https://www.emberjs.com/blog/\r\n",

    "body": "Today, [Embroider](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider) in compatibility mode can be used in new applications and in many existing applications. It is more difficult to use Embroider in `staticComponents`, mode, which is necessary to get the benefit of `splitAtRoutes` mode.\r\n\r\n[Issue #501](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/501) on the Embroider repository tracks the remaining issues needed to stabilize Embroider as a part of an Ember.js release.\r\n\r\nThis issue tracks the steps that we need to take before people can practically use Ember with Embroider as a supported option with route-based code splitting (\"Embroider readiness\"). While there are many granular ways to use Embroider (including a compatibility mode that offers few concrete benefits but is important for migrating Ember itself to Embroider by default), this issue is focused on the ability to use Embroider with a normal Ember application and get benefits from route-based code splitting.\r\n\r\n# Technical Requirements\r\n\r\nAs described in the [Embroider README](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider#options), in order to enable route-based code splitting (`splitAtRoutes`), an application must be able to enable these flags:\r\n\r\n- [ ] `staticAddonTestSupportTrees`\r\n- [ ] `staticAddonTrees`\r\n- [ ] `staticHelpers`\r\n- [ ] `staticComponents`\r\n\r\nIf an addon or application cannot work in the presence of these flags, they are using \"classic dynamic features\".\r\n\r\n# MVP: Deprecate and replace `(component dynamicString)`\r\n\r\nFor the first target of Embroider readiness (\"MVP\"), we need to eliminate the most common roadblocks that we've found when trying to enable the static flags in real-world applications.\r\n\r\nFor the MVP milestone, it is a *non-goal* for all ecosystem addons support these flags.\r\n\r\nInstead, the goal is for applications to have a reasonable transition path to `splitAtRoutes`, and that it's possible to build substantial, non-trivial applications in that mode. That means that all addons included in the default blueprint must have migrated away from classic dynamic features. It also means that addons that are frequently used in real-world applications, such as Ember concurrency, must not use classic dynamic features.\r\n\r\n## `staticComponents`\r\n\r\n**This is the most important static flag**, and its requirement poses the most substantial obstacle to the MVP target.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable `staticComponents`, an application (**including its addons**) must be free of all uses of `(component dynamicString)`.\r\n\r\nImportantly, applications and their addons **are allowed** to use `(component \"static string\")` in `staticComponents` mode.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this means that we will need to migrate away from patterns [like this](https://github.com/cardstack/cardstack/blob/1090743fadc3688aa503c7e2c908eeecd2ee69ba/packages/cardhost/app/components/scaffold.hbs#L1):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{{#let (component this.componentName) as | Component |}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAddons that currently take strings as part of their public API will need to, instead, take components, which would mean that this addon would need to migrate to an approach that required their *users* to supply the component to invoke, rather than a string.\r\n\r\n> This is a particularly thorny situation, since `this.component` is defined as <code>this.componentName = `scaffolding/${dasherize(csId!)}/${dasherize(this.args.feature)}`</code>. Situations like this are precisely the reason that we will need to think about and carefully roll out a transition strategy.\r\n\r\nAt minimum, in order to allow addons to migrate away from `(component dynamicString)`, we will need to create a new version of the `component` keyword that does not allow invocation of dynamic components.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we need to fix a [bug](https://ember-twiddle.com/73bd208d1acce6c2fddea71e01014302?openFiles=templates.application%5C.hbs%2C) that inadvertantly allows component invocation with angle-bracket syntax to work the same way as the dynamic `component` keyword. This needs to be done soon, because once people begin to try to migrate away from `(component dynamic)`, there's a high likelihood that people will accidentally migrate to `<dynamic>`, observe that it works, and move on.\r\n\r\nAction items:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Design and release a new version of `(component)` that only supports static strings (requires RFC)\r\n- [ ] Fix the bug that allows angle bracket invocation to behave like dynamic component invocation in Ember (bugfix, perhaps an intimate API)\r\n\r\n## `staticHelpers`\r\n\r\nThe `staticHelpers` flag does not reduce the expressiveness of Ember templates, but it means that the entire list of an application's helpers will not be available in the set of modules in the loader.\r\n\r\nWe assume that this will have breaking effects on Ember applications, but many fewer problems than `staticComponents`. We don't currently expect `staticHelpers` to affect the MVP target, but that may change as we attempt to upgrade applications to `splitAtRoutes`. If that happens, we will need to evaluate the problematic use-cases and consider new APIs to facilitate migration.\r\n\r\n## `staticAddonTrees` and `staticAddonTestSupportTrees`\r\n\r\nThe current assumption is that these flags are compatible with most idiomatic Ember apps and addons, and therefore do not pose any substantial problems for the requirements of the MVP target.\r\n\r\n# Next Steps\r\n\r\nThis issue is intended to remain as a tracking issue after we achieve the MVP target. After the MVP target, we will need to facilitate a complete ecosystem migration and improve the ergonomics of dynamic use-cases (which retaining support for code splitting). [Template imports](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/ba5ce1b78c8778de344b2fb16e24af18e5fcdcfd/text/0496-handlebars-strict-mode.md#how-we-teach-this) is likely to help achieve these goals.",

    "body": "Hey there,\r\n\r\nit seems like the router services behaves differently in an engine context compared to `{{#link-to}}` in views and `transitionTo` routes.\r\n\r\nExample: I want to link to my engine's route called 'overview'. The engine is mounted as 'engine'.\r\n\r\nThis is the expected and documented behavior:\r\nRoute: `this.transitionTo('overview')`\r\nViews: `{{#link-to 'overview'}}Link{{/link-to}}`\r\n\r\nWhereas the service requires the mount point additionally:\r\nService: `this.routerService.transitionTo('engine.overview')`\r\n\r\nI think all three ways should require the same route path.\r\n\r\nVersions:\r\n- `ember-source: ~3.2.0` \r\n- `ember-engines: ~0.5.4`\r\n\r\nHopefully, there's no other issue like that, but haven't found any while searching. Thanks!",

In the [current documentation for the each template helper](https://emberjs.com/api/ember/3.2/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/each?anchor=each) it talks about specifying keys but makes no mention of the special values for key, namely: \r\n\r\n@index - The index of the item in the array.\r\n@item - The item in the array itself. This can only be used for arrays of strings or numbers.\r\n@guid - Generate a unique identifier for each object (uses Ember.guidFor). \r\n\r\nWhich I discovered in this [comment](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/new-glimmer-consideration-each-key/8128/9)\r\n\r\nAre these special values actually still valid in 3.2? And if they are, is it alright if I write them back into the documentation?",

    "body": "`Router.map` hangs the callback functions it receives within `Router.constructor.dslCallbacks`.  In a traditional client-side rendered Ember-world, this is harmless.\n\nHowever, when you take into account FastBoot, this becomes unsafe if you call `Router.map` multiple times within your application those functions can leak across instances.  A particular use-case is we registered routes dynamically depending on user state and we do this inside of an instance-initializer.  \n\nThis isn't a terribly uncommon pattern; example is someone who wants to register routes in the language of the user.  This is likely the place where that would happen.\n\nWhere this becomes a problem in FastBoot is each time a request is made the callback is pushed to a property on the constructor and then enumerated over and invoked.  So for each request, a new callback is pushed into the array of callbacks and no clean up takes place (a memory leak and unsafe where functions from previous app instances are invoked).\n\nhttps://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/packages/ember-routing/lib/system/router.js#L89-L96\n\nAre the lines in question and so I was wondering if anyone would be opened to me moving these callbacks elsewhere, such as the application instance.  This will have larger ramifications, so would like to gather interest or feedback first.\n",

    "body": "This issue has been solved and is ready for someone to work on!\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\nRight now, most links in the Guides that point to the API docs have a hard-coded version number in them, like `https://emberjs.com/api/ember/2.16/classes/@ember%2Fapplication/methods/getOwner?anchor=getOwner`. We need to update this, especially while getting ready for 3.0\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\nThanks to some recent work in the API docs, now we can use a special url path called `release` that will point to the latest version, like `https://emberjs.com/api/ember/release/classes/@ember%2Fapplication/methods/getOwner?anchor=getOwner`. Making this change should theoretically be a careful find/replace of `/2.16/` for `/release/` in API urls found in the `.md` files of the Guides.\r\n\r\n**To do:**\r\n- [ ] try replacing the version with release in a few places to make sure it works as expected\r\n- [ ] update the urls throughout the guides with find/replace\r\n- [ ] Spot check the `release`ified links to make sure they work\r\n- [ ] review a diff to see if you made the changes you meant to, `git diff master`\r\n- [ ] Read through [this issue](https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/2085) to see which api urls weren't able to be fixed because documentation was missing. Make those changes. There shouldn't be missing docs anymore.\r\n- [ ] open a PR\r\n\r\nLinks were hard coded as a temporary measure in [this past PR](https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/2085) during the implementation of RFC 176.",

    "body": "As we worked through (at some length) in https://github.com/emberjs/guides/issues/1185 having multiple versions of the guides in search engine indices ends up diluting our ability to actually find **anything** using Google search.  It's not an ideal situation.  We'd been pending adding canonical urls to our old versions of the guides while we worked on adding better search to those versions of the guides, but that work has hit some snags (see https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/1750 for an example).  Rather than have that block us indefinitely, I'm starting in on adding canonical urls.  Help here would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nWe need to do two things to get this work done.\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to add the canonical url to the appropriate branch of the guides (see https://github.com/emberjs/guides/commit/60573df63f2d00590b0d9ca80cac402c3921d6b0 for an example) and send in a PR with the change to the appropriate branch:\r\n\r\n- [x] 1.10\r\n- [x] 1.11 (https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/1817)\r\n- [ ] 1.12 (copy the PR to 1.11)\r\n- [ ] 1.13 (copy the PR to 1.11)\r\n- [ ] 2.0 (copy the PR to 1.11)\r\n- [ ] 2.1 (copy the PR to 1.11)\r\n- [ ] 2.2\r\n- [x] 2.3\r\n- [x] 2.4\r\n- [x] 2.5\r\n- [ ] 2.6\r\n- [ ] 2.7\r\n- [ ] 2.8\r\n- [ ] 2.9\r\n- [ ] 2.10\r\n- [ ] master\r\n\r\nSecond (this is the harder part), we need to send in the built version of the guides to the https://github.com/emberjs/guides.emberjs.com repo.  To do this, you'll need to do the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. `bundle exec middleman build` in your updated `guides` repo\r\n2. replace the `snapshots/<version>` folder in the `guides.emberjs.com` repo with the new `build` folder in your `guides` repo\r\n3. run `node task/update-version.js <version>` in the root of the `guides.emberjs.com` repo to update some necessary places in your new built files\r\n4. send in a PR\r\n\r\nThese are the versions that still need to be updated:\r\n- [x] 1.10 (https://github.com/emberjs/guides.emberjs.com/pull/34)\r\n- [x] 1.11 (https://github.com/emberjs/guides.emberjs.com/pull/35)\r\n- [ ] 1.12 (PR should look similar to v1.11)\r\n- [ ] 1.13\r\n- [ ] 2.0\r\n- [ ] 2.1\r\n- [ ] 2.2\r\n- [x] 2.3 (https://github.com/emberjs/guides.emberjs.com/pull/33)\r\n- [x] 2.4 (https://github.com/emberjs/guides.emberjs.com/pull/33)\r\n- [x] 2.5 (https://github.com/emberjs/guides.emberjs.com/pull/33)\r\n- [ ] 2.6\r\n- [ ] 2.7\r\n- [ ] 2.8\r\n- [ ] 2.9\r\n- [ ] 2.10",

    "body": "https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.4.0/getting-started/core-concepts/\n\nI'm trying to work on the translations and there were a couple of things that tripped me up a bit, so I want to just give my take on this.\n\n> Templates can also display properties provided to them from their context, which is either a component or a route (technically, a controller presents the model from the route to the template, but this is rarely used in modern Ember apps and will be deprecated soon)\n\nThat sentence in the parens is really long, and if you translate it into German it just gets longer (that's just how German works :P). Additionally, there's not really a word for \"deprecated\" and I'd have to more verbosely explain it (i.e. something like \"this is going away in a future version\" or something). Also, I think for an introduction to the concepts it's just a bit too technical maybe. Furthermore I'm just not sure what it means to say that \"technically there is a controller, but it is not used\". I don't want to step on anyone's toes but I'm kinda really having a hard time with that half-sentence. If you really have to talk about controllers on this page, maybe it should be a separate session (even if that session basically only says \"controllers are there for technical and legacy reasons and should not be explicitly used for new code\" or something to that effect).\n\n> Here, {{name}} is a property provided by the template's context.\n> \n> Besides properties, double curly braces ({{}}) may also contain helpers and components, which we'll discuss later.\n\nMaybe, for the sake of consistency, we might want to refer to `name` as the property, instead of `{{name}}`, especially since the next sentence basically says that curly braces _contain_ properties\n\n> While templates describe how a user interface looks, components control how the user interface behaves.\n> \n> Components consist of two parts: a template written in Handlebars, and a source file written in JavaScript that defines the component's behavior.\n\nTo my mind, that's contradictory. First we establish an opposition between templates and components, but then we say that a component also has a template file. I'm not sure how to resolve this, but it sounds less than optimal to me. This is probably due to the fact that \"component\" can both mean the JS + template combination, but it can also refer only to the JS file. The first sentence kind of uses that latter meaning of \"component\", while in the second sentence we use the first meaning. To a novice, I don't think this is obvious.\nAgain, I'm not sure what else to suggest. Maybe something like \"Sometimes (often?) you want to add behaviour to parts of your UI. To that effect you can use components. Components consist of two parts ...\"?\n\nI realize that some of this is due to the limbo that Ember is currently in, moving away from controllers, so I realise that it's hard to come up with good descriptions for the concepts. The guides have improved substantially since I started with Ember, so thumbs up to anyone involved. :+1: \n",

    "body": "The \"looks like they are blocking calls\" aspect of async test is extremely cool, and clearly requires a great deal of internal magic.  Unfortunately, the complexity of that magic makes it difficult for mere mortals to understand.  In addition, one cannot be certain what portions of existing behavior are part of the API \"contract\" and what might be implementation details subject to change.\n\nThe root problem is that neither the documentation on the registerAsyncHelper function  (http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Test.html#method_registerAsyncHelper) nor the testing guides (https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.2.0/testing/acceptance/) provide any indication on the contract between Ember and the return value of the function that implements the async test helper.  \n\n\"Built-in\" async test helpers such as \"click\" all seem to end with \n\n```\nreturn app.testHelpers.wait();\n```\n\nwhich returns a `Promise` that waits for a variety of activity within the system to die down.  From that, one might intuit that it is the return of that `Promise` that implements the \"wait for activity to complete\" behavior.  The examples within the guides, however (and the example given in the API) do _not_ return a value, and yet exhibit the same behavior.  (More magic.)\n\nThis leads to questions like:\n1. If an async test helper returns a `Promise`, is Ember guaranteed to wait for the `Promise` to be resolved before moving on?  (i.e. before that async helper \"appears\" to return so that the next line in the test case executes)\n2. If so, is an async helper allowed to return _any_ kind of `Promise`, or must the `Promise` be (or chain to) the one returned by `app.testHelpers.wait()`?\n3. How, if at all, does the behavior of an async helper differ if it returns a `Promise` as opposed to returning nothing?\n4. What is the relationship between a `Promise` returned by an async helper and the `Promise`s returned by any other async helpers that it calls?  (Example: the sample in the guide calls 'visit' and 'click', both of which return `app.testHelpers.wait()`.  What if that helper had also returned a `Promise`?  What, if any, linkages are established between those `Promise`s?\n5. Under what situations (if any) would returning the `Promise` generated by `app.testHelpers.wait()` be _required_?\n6. The API documentation includes the statement `All async helpers after it will wait for it complete before running.`.  What about \"regular\" (non-async) helpers?  Do they get delayed as well?  Or can one not follow a call to an async helper with a call to a \"sync\" helper?\n\nWith regard to `Promise`s other than that generated by `app.testHelpers.wait()`, there are a number of cases that I can think of where one might want to write an async helper that did not actually trigger any activity inside Ember itself.  For example, suppose that one was writing a \"full\" acceptance test that actually communicated with a back-end service (as opposed to having the communications mocked out.)  In this case, one might want to:\n1. Execute an Ajax transaction at the beginning of a test case in order to set up preconditions in the back end for that test case.\n2. Execute an Ajax transaction at the end of a test case in order to verify that post-conditions on the back end have been satisfied.\n\nIn these cases, one might want to return a \"vanilla\" `Promise` that would resolve when the ajax transaction completed, and not to have the async helper complete until that `Promise` resolved.  (Yes, I know that `app.testHelpers.wait()` seems to wait for transactions run through Ember.$.ajax to complete, but what if one didn't use Ember.$.ajax?  Can that be made to work?  Or is the participation of  `app.testHelpers.wait()` required?)\n\nThus, a better statement of how Ember uses the return value from the async test helper function, and possible an example or two that involve the creation of an async helper that isn't just a call to pre-defined async helpers, would be _really_ useful.\n",
