    "body": "This issue is for tracking the progress of and items for completing the 101  Contact Book tutorial. The tutorial is meant to be a thorough guide for SPA framework beginners that ramps them up slowly, as opposed to the existing [Super Rentals](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/ember-cli/) tutorial which is targeted at more experienced developers. \r\n\r\n# Overview\r\n\r\nThe concept for this tutorial is a barebones contact manager app, such as the Contacts app on MacOS. Aurelia has a [similar application](https://aurelia.io/docs/tutorials/creating-a-contact-manager#building-the-application-shell) for there tutorial, which has been a source of inspiration for this tutorial.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this tutorial is to fill a gap that our existing tutorials skip over, which is a thorough guide to building a basic SPA for someone with little-to-no experience with frontend frameworks. Some of the major issues with the existing tutorials are:\r\n\r\n* **Lack of focus on Components.** Most frontend frameworks these days start with Components, and build abstractions slowly on top of those. Concepts that are there by default in Ember, such as Routes, Models, Controllers, etc. can be confusing to newcomers, and make Ember seem overly complicated by comparison.\r\n* **Data management.** Frontend devs often understand the basics of `$.ajax` or `fetch` and know how to communicate with backends and APIs. Ember Data is a powerful solution that throws a whole bunch of abstractions on top of these primitives, and can be very confusing to new users. It also makes Ember Data appear to be a required part of Ember, which may deter users who are more familiar with alternative data layers such as Apollo.  \r\n* **Testing.** Tests are one of Ember's strengths, and we should include a full demonstration of tests in every tutorial, but the TDD style of tests in Super Rentals is very heavy handed. For beginners learning the basics, it can feel like too much at once.\r\n\r\nGiven these factors, the idea here is to make a tutorial that focusses on the basics first, and builds up to more complicated features more gradually. It is also meant to mimic the tutorials for other frameworks, so that we can leverage our similarities to these other frameworks to accelerate learning within ours.\r\n\r\n# Outline\r\n\r\nRather than introduce all of the Ember concepts at once, the tutorial currently starts with just one - Components. Everything in the app is built using components so learners can really focus on all the ways that they can be used, including component patterns such as container/presentational components and other concepts that are becoming common in the larger SPA framework world. The components are built to be fully functional, but with mock data (e.g. POJOs on the Component instance) instead of loading any data or communicating with the backend.\r\n\r\nOnce the basic app has been built with components, we focus on adding a basic data layer. We start by using simple `fetch` requests against a service (currently [located here](https://github.com/rtablada/contact-book-server)) directly in components, and then extract those requests out into a Service (this is also where we introduce Services, and explain them as the general solution to long term state in Ember).\r\n\r\nAfter that's all done, we refactor the application using Routes and the Router. This demonstrates the value of the Router at the same time as introducing it when it makes sense - when an app has reached enough complexity.\r\n\r\nFinally, we add tests. This should be a thorough demonstration of how to write tests in Ember, both overall acceptance tests and component integration tests. \r\n\r\n# Supplemental Resources\r\n\r\nThe tutorial should have a reference implementation in the form of a git repo, much like Super Rentals. The git repo should have commits for every step in the tutorial, so users can jump to a commit and see the code they should be targetting. Ideally tags should be added as well. See the [Super Rentals reference app](https://github.com/ember-learn/super-rentals).\r\n\r\n# Quest items\r\n\r\n- [ ] Pages\r\n  - [x] Setup\r\n    - [x] Setting Up\r\n    - [x] The Application Template \r\n  - [x] Introduction to Components\r\n    - [x] Creating the Details Component\r\n    - [x] Using a Container Component\r\n    - [x] Creating the Contact List\r\n  - [ ] Data Management\r\n    - [ ] Loading Contacts from the Server\r\n    - [ ] Creating and Editing Contacts\r\n    - [ ] Adding a Service\r\n  - [ ] Routing\r\n    - [ ] Refactoring with Routes\r\n  - [ ] Testing\r\n    - [ ] Testing the App\r\n    - [ ] Finishing Up\r\n\r\n- [ ] Contact Book Repo [[link](https://github.com/ember-learn/contact-book)]\r\n  - [ ] Setup of commits on master\r\n  \r\n- [ ] Contact Book Server [[link](https://github.com/rtablada/contact-book-server)]\r\n  - [ ] Ensure it's working\r\n  - [ ] Transfer to `ember-learn` org\r\n\r\n- [ ] Misc\r\n  - [ ] Styles and design of the Contact Book app",

This is mostly there but the author name and details need to be moved slightly to match the design in Abstract\r\n\r\n<img width=\"454\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-07-28 at 21 31 45\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/594890/88718390-ceac3000-d119-11ea-93e3-022f648b28bb.png\">\r\n\r\nAbstract link: https://share.goabstract.com/a0507989-278d-4684-9c1c-c436eddbba2b?collectionLayerId=494a5919-3bdc-437f-8971-8a947fe05e81&mode=design\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what it looks like currently: https://deploy-preview-7--ember-blog-legacy.netlify.app/author/matthew-beale\r\n\r\nIf you would like to work on this issue you can \"claim\" it by commenting and letting us know that you would like to work on it 👍 \r\n\r\n**Notes: **\r\n\r\n- the pagination on this page has a \"read more\" button which does not match the Abstract. This is expected and is not part of this issue\r\n- There is a different issue to properly style the `<hr>` tags https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide/issues/329\r\n- you should make sure that the tag sidebar that is available on other pages shows up on the author page (I think there is some code that is telling it to hide itself which can be removed)\r\n\r\n## Supporting information - please read if you are new to this project\r\n\r\nThis redesign effort is powered by the new version of the Ember Styleguide. You should be able to implement everything you need for this feature by following the [new documentation for the ember-styleguide](https://deploy-preview-145--ember-styleguide.netlify.com/) but if you think there is not enough documentation please let us know and we will point you in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIn most cases you should not need any CSS to implement this issue for the blog template, you should instead be trying to make use of the helpers and components that are documented in the ember-styleguide. This is not a strict rule, there may be cases where the documentation in the ember-styleguide is lacking or some custom CSS is actually needed. If you have any questions please comment on this issue or reach out to us on the `#st-website` channel on the [Ember Community Discord](https://discord.gg/emberjs)\r\n",

    "body": "This quest issue is related to the [Contribution Guides RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/446)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIn the context of the [Contribution Guides RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/446) we require content for the first release of the website. Several topics about open-source, project interaction and workflows are supposed be covered as part of this first pass of a curriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Who can work on this issue?\r\n\r\nWe need volunteers who\r\n- have basic knowledge of using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)\r\n- have a basic knowledge of using [Git](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)\r\n- are up to write about contribution and open-source\r\n\r\n## How can I work on this issue?\r\n\r\nTake a look through the list of topics and claim an open one by mentioning that you'd like to work on it in the comments below. Once a sub topic is claimed, the task will be locked for a week to be worked on by the person who volunteered. Please only claim a single issue at a time. An issue will be marked as done as soon as a relevant PR covering the topic item has been merged.\r\n\r\n\r\n## List of Topics\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\n- [ ] Introduction / Index : Write one or several paragraphs about what Ember is and how the project relates to Open Source (🔏 @jessica-jordan)\r\n- [ ] Introduction / Index: Write one or several paragraphs about what open-source is, its benefits for projects and the community\r\n- [ ] Introduction / Index: Write one or several paragraphs about why someone should contribute to open source, what the benefits + challenges of becoming an OSS contributor are and a few encouraging words about why each contribution matters\r\n\r\n### Find a Project\r\n\r\n- [ ] Find a Project / Types of Contribution: Write one or several paragraphs about why Ember encourages different kinds of contributions to the project\r\n- [ ] Find a Project / Types of Contribution: Create a list of all different types of contribution to the project and the community with relevant links to already existing resources (e.g. `Organize a meetup` with a link pointing to https://emberjs.com/community/meetups)\r\n- [ ] Find a Project / Start a Project: Write one or several paragraphs about why someone might want to start their own project if they weren't able to find an already existing initiative. This section might want to mention things like how to create an addon or create a screencast series. Please provide relevant links to existing resources to learn where possible\r\n\r\n\r\n### Make a Contribution\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make a Contribution / Index: Write at least one paragraph about why writing issues on a Github repository of an Ember project is important and how it helps other contributors.  Be sure to include some encouraging words for first time contributors in particular. Looking for inspiration? Be sure to check out the particular question \"What's your advice for first-time contributors\" from each of the interviews in the [Contributor Interview Series](https://discuss.emberjs.com/search?q=%22I%20contribute%20to%20Ember%22%20category%3A22)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make a Contribution / File an Issue: Write a detailed Guide on how to file an issue on a Github repo of the Ember org. Please mention concepts as searching for already existing issues, finding a suitable issue title,  how to write a clear description for a bug or feature request, how to use labels  and how to check back on comments to an issue. Please add high-resolution screenshots for each of the different UI steps for creating and submitting an issue\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make a Contribution / How to Git: Explain how to setup your local environment for a code contribution, including: Git Installation on Windows / Mac / Linux, forking a repo, check out a forked repo\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make a Contribution / How to Git: Explain how to create a feature branch, edit files and add these changes via Git, how to commit changes and write descriptive commit messages, how to push the feature branch to a remote of a forked repo\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make a Contribution / How to Git: Explain how to open a pull request from a feature branch, how to request reviews for a PR and how to communicate during code review. Please also explain the basics of branch checks (e.g. via Travis CI) and the meaning of the approved / commented / requested changes PR states. Be sure to remind readers that feedback on a PR is helpful and a friendly attitude, as well as checking back on their open PRs goes a long way in making their contribution a success. It might also be worth noting that everyone, and especially the reviewer, is there to help.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make a Contribution / Making Code Contributions: 2 examples of project specific contributions (e.g. Ember + Ember CLI). For reference, be sure to check out the Contributing guides of both [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Ember CLI](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make a Contribution / Making Code Contributions: Describe where to find project specific guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md) for each particular project. Be sure to also mention how to get into contact with project maintainers either via Github or the Ember Discord server. Also be sure to describe when and where to ask for more guidance on an already open pull request or when starting work on a new issue\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make a Contribution / Writing RFCs: Process of RFC writing and discussion",

Objects\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create an example (the example may need to depend on the surrounding page context)\r\n- [ ] Explain that Ember does not react to `this.myObject.myProperty = ...;`.\r\n- [ ] Explain possible solutions\r\n  - immutable approach\r\n  - native class\r\n  - `tracked-built-ins`\r\n\r\n### 3. Backport\r\n\r\nOnce the changes are approved for `release` directory, backport the changes all the way back to Ember 3.15.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n- We have 2 pages (Autotracking In-Depth & Tracked Properties) with almost similar content. Can one page refer to another?",

    "body": "## Current Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe [Input Helper Section](https://guides.emberjs.com/v3.4.0/templates/input-helpers/) on the Guides highlights how different types of the `input` helper can be used.\r\nWhen reviewing the section on how to bind actions to the `{{input}}` helper (https://guides.emberjs.com/v3.4.0/templates/input-helpers/#toc_actions), the following statement is made:\r\n\r\n```Event Names must be dasherized.```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"805\" alt=\"capture d ecran 2018-10-03 a 00 22 42\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811742/46380494-c19b9280-c6a2-11e8-9ca5-6238d5021505.png\">\r\n\r\nThis is in fact only true for the `{{input}}` helper with the `type=\"text\"`. This input helper requires the dasherized event name to be used to attach any actions:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{{input type=\"text\" focus-in=(action \"highlightUser\")}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther types of input helpers which do not rely on the `TextSupport` Mixin do not own any dasherized event name API and actions can only be attached to their respective event handlers via the camelizedSyntax (e.g. `focusIn`). An example for a kind of input helper which does not own any functionality of the `TextSupport` Mixin is the one with `type=\"checkbox\"`. For this, you can only attach actions as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{{input type=\"checkbox\" focusIn=(action \"highlightUser\")}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease also review [this stellar outline of the differences between both these uses in this issue](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16171).\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe section describing actions used with the `{{input}}` helper should explicitly describe which type of input helper will require which type of event name wording (dasherized vs. camelized). Preferrably, this section should highlight a table of all input helper types available and their corresponding event name style.\r\n\r\nPlease find out which input helpers / text area helpers are based on the [`TextSupport` mixin](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/packages/@ember/-internals/views/lib/mixins/text_support.js) and list those together with the dasherized version of viable event names. All other input / text helper types should be listed together with the camelized version of the viable event names.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nPlease update the Guides Source not only for the latest release `3.4`, but for any other preceding versions which include the statement about dasherized event names.\r\n\r\n## Sources\r\n- Guides Section on Actions Used With the Input Helper: https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.18.0/templates/input-helpers/#toc_actions\r\n- Original Issue about Discrepancy between `{{input type=\"text}}` and `{{input type=\"checkbox\"}}` regarding action binding: https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16171\r\n- Ember Twiddle Demo from the Original Issue: https://ember-twiddle.com/6f82aa1cce20e0831e285c172ca7e998\r\n- Documentation on the Text Support Mixin: https://www.emberjs.com/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.TextSupport\r\n\r\n\r\n",

But really, both Ember and Ember Data deserve their own landing pages!\r\n\r\nTo do:\r\n- Following the same pattern as #637, create a new page that has a list of commonly-searched-for documentation for Ember Data. Use your instincts about what to include - likely models, serializers, and adapters.\r\n- See the PR #637 for where to make the routing changes so that users see it when they visit `release/ember-data`\r\n- If you only get as far as making a list of commonly searched for links, that's ok! Go ahead and make a PR, and other contributors may help with doing the routing.\r\n\r\nHere is the landing page that exists today that covers only Ember.js:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1248\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-15 at 11 59 53 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16627268/96211547-99f28c80-0f42-11eb-85b5-4e5322f7fc50.png\">\r\n",

And, of course, https://guides.emberjs.com/v3.17.0/ember-inspector/view-tree/ should be removed.\r\n\r\nThe first phase of the work is to identify which screenshots are out of date so they can be replicated. For now I would not change the introduction page. Part of this work is also confirm which versions of ember.js make Ember Inspector show the \"View Tree\" or not, so we can backport the updated screenshots to the Guides for that version.\r\n\r\nOnce we have agreed on the work identified in the previous phase, we move to the second phase where we create issues to address said work.",

    "body": "In ember-cli (for a very very long time) it has been possible to have ember-cli use a different main entry point for the addon than what a normal `require('my-package-name')` would return.\r\n\r\nThe way to do this is to add an `\"ember-addon\": { \"main\": \"some-other-file.js\" }` to your `package.json`. Normal `require` invocation will look at the `main` entry point, and `ember-cli` will look at `some-other-file.js`.\r\n\r\nOne nice benefit of this is that if you make `main` be `addon/index.js` and `ember-addon.main` be `index.js`, \"normal\" node_module resolution rules apply for things in `addon/index.js`. This means that things like `eslint-plugin-import` and `TypeScript` can actual see and validate an import from the addon name (though not with nested paths). \r\n\r\nFor example, typescript (and eslint-plugin-import) would see that this is valid:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport Component from 'sparkles-component';\r\n\r\nexport default class extends Component {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/rwjblue/sparkles-component/pull/23 as an example.",

I'd suggest using a shortened adaptation of [Jen's post](https://medium.com/ember-ish/easy-select-element-in-ember-js-dde318c07110) that is one of the top Google hits for _ember select_.\r\n\r\nAn alternative could be to create an RFC for making the `x-select` addon part of Ember, like the `{{input}}` and `{{textarea}}` helpers are. I believe including a built-in `<select>` helper was rejected a long time ago when the `select` view was deprecated, but I don't know the details.\r\n\r\nIf this is acceptable, I'll make a PR.",

    "body": "Let's teach Ember Data better! Developers face three main hurdles when learning Ember Data, and by completing the issues linked below, we can improve the learning story. The challenges at a high level are:\r\n\r\n1. Not knowing where the line is between Ember and Ember Data\r\n2. Hard to know which API methods to use when\r\n3. Fundamental misunderstanding of the point of serializers, as a way to turn any response into JSON:API\r\n\r\nHere's how we'll overcome these. PRs should branch from `master` and target `master` for a merge.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Find the places in the Guides where Ember Data functions are referenced, outside of the \"Ember Data\" section of the guides. Add an explicit note that the example uses Ember Data, and maybe a link to that part of the Guides or API docs. \r\n- [ ] Show sample req and res objects/spec for different adapters/serializers\r\n- [ ] Replace \"customizing\" language for serializers. I think we could simplify the mental model for everyone by teaching more about what a serializer is and how to write one instead of focusing on “customizing”\r\n- [ ] Focus serializer explanations around most useful API methods. There are only 3 necessary methods, only 2 of which are “happy path”. Those methods are `normalizeResponse` `serialize` and `pushPayload`, and each can be described in an ideal world as “a pure function that converts from non-json-api to json-api or vice-versa”. The 2 happy path methods are `normalizeResponse` and `serialize`\r\n- [ ] make sure distinction between `model` and `record` is clear. `record` for instances and `ModelClass` for the class\r\n- [ ] better intro explaining what adapters are\r\n- [ ] overall, gradually align on json-api terminology within ember-data, e.g. instead of saying `record` say `resource` and `resource-identifier`\r\n- [x] provide a proper intro to Ember Data in the Guides\r\n- [ ] Split out Ember Data into its own Guide (way down the road, after we do the same for Tutorials)\r\n\r\nHelpful terminology definitions:\r\n- `store`: a cache for `records`\r\n- `Model`: a schema class used when instantiating a `record`\r\n- `Adapter`: a request-manager: it takes instructions on what to find and manages the process of making an API request and returning the response. Essentially an abstraction over fetch.\r\n- `Serializer`: a formatter used to convert your API responses into json-api format if they are not already (caveat, needs to be a subset of json-api (camelCase member names and dasherized, singularized types)\r\n- `finders`: a utility method for chaining together `request => format data => update cache`\r\n- `records` (e.g. instances of Models) - think of them as “remote state”. A `record` is some data that lives outside of the lifecycle of the application, e.g. on your server",

    "body": "With the Anniversary Edition of Windows 10, Edge doesn't display the dropdown of the version selector. Clicking the dropdown shows an empty list and the version appears as blank after that. Also, the black background for the example text isn't showing, making the examples hard to read. \r\n\r\nBoth issues occur on:\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft Edge 38.14393.2068.0\r\nMicrosoft EdgeHTML 14.14393\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it works in:\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft Edge 42.17134.1.0\r\nMicrosoft EdgeHTML 17.17134\r\n```\r\n\r\nI dug around a little. While poised on object `ember619` - the article panel - the browser reports an unhandled exception `Object doesn't support property or method 'ToString'` in `didRender` of `guides-app/components/es-form/es-textfield`. Maybe something's getting fouled up there and interrupting it before it can populate the dropdown of the sidebar. It hits this once on the quick start page and sometimes more than once on each of the other pages I tried. And, yes, 'ToString' in the error has a capital T.\r\n\r\nThe other problem I noticed in passing. The examples with a header, like the HBS one on the Quick Start page, have the expected black background, but the plain examples, like the one with `cd ember-quickstart \\n ember serve`, have no background, leaving strangely ghostly outline text. Comparing with more recent Edge, the `<pre>` tag in the old one has class `line-numbers` but no `language-bash`.\r\n\r\nHopefully, @sivakumar-kailasam, this will give you a head start. Many thanks!",

Note that these are improvements to the presentation, not changes to the content.  \r\n\r\n- [ ] \"Injecting Dependencies\": this would be a rework of the current \"Factory Injections\" section. It should lead with what is currently labeled \"Ad-Hoc\" injections. That label is bad because it makes it sounds like they're wrong, when really they are the best way to do it. It can then move on to type injections and instance injections, but making it clear that those are _advanced_ techniques typically used within addon libraries.\r\n- [ ] \"Looking Up Dependencies\": this is the current \"Factory Instance Lookups\" section. There's no reason to hammer people with jargon like \"factory instance\", just stick to \"dependency\" throughout this page, the page is about _dependency_ injection.\r\n- [ ] \"Registering Dependencies\": this would be a rework of the current \"Factory Registrations\" section. It should only presume knowledge of Initializers (which it can hyperlink to), and it should show all the examples _in the context of_ initializers. It does _not_ need to introduce the words \"registry\" or \"owner\" or \"Application\" or \"ApplicationInstance\". It can introduce the word \"factory\" to explain the difference between the default behavior and `instantiate: false`.\r\n- [ ] \"Understanding the Ember DI Architecture\": this is where we'd put the highly abstract stuff defining \"registry\" and \"owner\". Even here I would drop attempts to define Application and ApplicationInstance. It's not central to the text, and you can hyperlink to their own API docs. We should also explain the real concrete reason that \"registry\" and \"owner\" are separate: you can share the registry across all users in FastBoot, whereas each user owns their own separate state (separate \"owner\").\r\n\r\n## Part Two: Update Content for Octane\r\nThe content changes we need for Octane and native classes are:\r\n\r\n- [ ] all uses of `extend` should become native class extend instead\r\n- [ ] this implies teaching `inject` as a decorator\r\n- [ ] the examples that use `@ember/component` would change to use `@glimmer/component`",
