        Improving the contributor experience
      </h2>

      <p local-class="paragraph">
        This app is designed to help community members find issues in the Ember
        ecosystem that are requesting some extra help! The goal would be for
        this to work well for project nights for meetups, conferences and anyone
        else interested in hacking on various projects while also helping the
        main Ember repositories get much needed help with issues.
      </p>

      <h3>Big Picture</h3>

      <p local-class="paragraph">
        To accomplish this, we use a
        <a href="https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-help-wanted-server">Node
          backend</a>
        that receives Github webhook notifications about issues across a number
        of Ember projects. The backend will filter those issues and store them
        to act as our "pool" of potential issues that potential contributors can
        work on.
      </p>

      <p local-class="paragraph">
        Those issues will then surface in this Ember app, where they can be
        searched and filtered in various ways as each potential contributor
        desires. We may add some level of curation to the issues (whether that
        is needed is still to be determined) or in other ways editorialize as
        issues show up in the app.
      </p>

      <p local-class="paragraph">
        Meetup organizers (and contributor workshops at various Ember
        conferences) can also use this as a tool to sort through issues and pick
        subsets for their meetings. For example, if a Meetup group wants to help
        its members learn more about Ember Data, a meetup organizer could go
        through the existing pool of issues and cherry-pick 5-10 issues for
        folks to focus on for that evening that would help with that. This tool
        could be used as a foundation for running the Contributors Workshop that
        occurs each year at EmberConf.
      </p>

      <p local-class="paragraph">
        Long-term, we are considering ways to make this easily findable by
        anyone who wants to contribute to Ember- tweeting out major new issues,
        or in other ways that communicate key pieces of info to the Ember
        community. We could potentially use it as a way of posting "maintainer
        wanted" messages as well. Do you have more ideas? Let us know!
